- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}` - Update order
- `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` - Delete order

### Designs
- `GET /api/designs` - List all designs
- `GET /api/designs/{id}` - Get specific design
- `POST /api/designs` - Create new design
- `PUT /api/designs/{id}` - Update design

### Additional Endpoints
- Customers, Employees, Stores, Payments, etc.

## Frontend Components

### Pages
- **Landing**: Marketing landing page
- **Login**: Authentication form
- **Dashboard**: Main overview page
- **Orders**: Order management interface
- **Designs**: Design management interface

### Components
- **Layout**: Main application layout with navigation
- **AuthContext**: Authentication state management
- **API Service**: Centralized API communication

## Development Setup

### Backend
1. Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
2. Set up PostgreSQL database
3. Update connection string in `appsettings.json`
4. Run migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
5. Start API: `dotnet run`

### Frontend
1. Navigate to `decal-xe-frontend` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Update API URL in `.env` file
4. Start development server: `npm start`

## Production Deployment

### Backend
- Configure production database connection
- Set up JWT secrets and security configurations
- Deploy to cloud platform (Azure, AWS, etc.)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Frontend
- Build production bundle: `npm run build`
- Deploy static files to CDN or web server
- Configure environment variables for production API

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- JWT token authentication
- Password hashing
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention via Entity Framework
- CORS configuration

### Recommended Additions
